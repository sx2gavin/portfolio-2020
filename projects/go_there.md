# Introduction

![menu]({{ site.url | absolute_url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/gothere/menu.png)

GoThere! is a 3D low-poly puzzle adventure game made by Unity. It was inspired by the blocky art style of Minecraft, and the friendly control and playability of Super Mario Brothers. It's a puzzle game to challenge your problem solving skill and your attention to details. For each level, you need to reach a goal, but there will be many obstacles along the way so you need to be extra careful! You can also collect three coins along the way, but they are not at all easy to get! You have to be really familiar with the control and the map to get them. Enjoy!
